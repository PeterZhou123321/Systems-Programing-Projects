My least favorite brand is Supercell. I started playing the Supercell game back in 2013. Although Supercell has well-known
games such as "Clash of Clans" and "Clash Royale", they have become more and more cash-grabs and pay-to-win recently.
Supercell is killing their own game and causing long-term players to quit. People who spend less time but put more money
into the game have higher rewards than people who spend tons of time without paying. If I were a market consultant
for Supercell, I would apply an approach based on audience understanding, and innovative marketing strategies are crucial.
Firstly, a deep comprehension of the target audience is vital.
Regular updates, new features, and in-game events can keep content fresh and players engaged. Secondly, 
community engagement stands as a cornerstone in the gaming industry. If you can't catch the attention of long-term players,
the game will not last long. Supercell can foster active forums and social media groups and encourage in-game interactions.
They should focus more on making new content than bundles tempting us to pay. This engagement should extend beyond
participation; incorporating player feedback into game development can create a sense of ownership and loyalty among users.
In conclusion, by embracing a strategy that prioritizes user experience, community engagement, and continuous innovation,
Supercell can retain its market position and expand its player base. Moreover, cross-promotions and strategic partnerships
can introduce the games to new audiences while keeping the existing players.
